# List of TODOs
For your pleasure, here is a list of todos:<br>
**TODO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BUILD THE PROJECT ON A DIFFERENT DEVICE**
<br>
<br>

### Console
- **TODO: IMPLEMENT ON THE CONSOLE a way to generate a new certificate**
- **TODO ADD A WAY FOR THE SERVER AND CLIENT TO PROCESS AND SEND A MESSAGE.**
- **TODO ADD A WAY TO NAVIGATE THROUGH FILES WITH A CLIENT**
- **TODO ADD, FOR THE ADMIN, TO SEE HOW MUCH MEMORY IS ALLOCATED TO A USER**
<br>
<br>

### Concurrecy
- **TODO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO SYNCHRONIZED CONCURRENCY**
<br>
<br>

### Files and storage
- **TODO IMPLEMENT a way to limit the storage of a user**
- **TODO List_files_and_directories deve funzionare sulla cartella in cui si Ã¨ ora, non su una cartella specificata**
- **TODO GIVE 5MB OF STORAGE OR SOME OTHER SMALL AMOUNT TO THE SERVER FOLDER, SO THAT IT CAN KEEP ALL INFO ABOUT THE USERS, AND THE CERTIFICATE**
- **TODO If the storage to accept the received data becomes insufficient during the receiving operation, send a message (TODO: IMPLEMENT THIS) to say that the storage is not enough, then start a timer of FILE_DISCARDING_TIMEOUT milliseconds, start discarding all characters until you reach MESSAGE_END_SEPARATOR, if you don't reach it in time for the timer to expire then close the connection with the client who sent the file too big. This is to protect from attackers sending a file too big, then not sending the message ending character but sending random junk data to keep the connection alive**
- **TODO ALSO MEMORY COULD BE SUFFICIENT AT THE START OF THE REQUEST BUT COULD NOT BECOME SUFFICIENT AS THE DATA IS SENT, SO YOU HAVE TO SEND A NOT_SUFFICIENT_STORAGE MESSAGE IN THAT SITUATION, TOO, AND ELIMINATE THE FILES THAT WERE GENERATING**
- **TODO TO KEEP THE ACTIVE MAP OF CLIENTS AND THEIR KEYS, USE A THREAD SAFE IMPLEMENTATION OF MAP**
- **CONSIDER THAT YOU CANNOT CALCULATE HOW MUCH STORAGE IS BEING USED BY SERVER BY HOW MUCH STORAGE IS ALLOCATED, BECAUSE THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE LESS IS ALLOCATED THAN WHAT IS OCCUPIED**
- **TODO MANAGE INSTALLATION OF SERVER**
- 
<br>
<br>

### Protocol
- **TODO IMPLEMENT AS FOLLOWS: the raw data length HAS TO BE KEPT IN A `BigInteger` BECAUSE INT IS LIMITED TO 2 BILLION, WHICH IN BYTES IS 2 GIGS: BUG**
- **TODO ENSURE THE SENT KEY ON FIRST CONNECTION IS OF THE CORRECT FORMAT**
- **TODO IMPLEMENT CERTIFICATES**
- **TODO I WANT TO USE BASE85 ENCODING TO TRANSMIT DATA, IMPLEMENT**
- **TODO IMPLEMENTATION TO HAVE A REGEX WHERE ALL FIELDS OF THE HEADER ARE SEPARATED BY |**


<br>
<br>

### User management

# ServerPhone
_Believe it or not, this is the third time i delete this repo because of configurations issues, which took me a day to sort out.<br>
I finally managed to publish my work here, i will keep you posted here._<br>
<br>
Special thanks go to classical, jazz, phonk, and rock music for keeping me company during the creation of this little project.<br>
<br>
This project supports full JavaDoc documentation, so feel free to consult it.<br>
<br>
The documention in this file is comprehensive and aims to have enough detail, so that one could run with it and make their own implementation.<br>
If something is unclear, please do feel free to contribute in any way you see fit.

## Purpose
This client/server application is a media server and a passion project, which aims to repurpose an old phone to act as a cloud (i know it's not technically a cloud because it's not distributed) for myself. This doesn't spawn from a practical need of such a device, but rather from a craving for an applied project, and this seems to be the coolest project i could come up with.
<br>
<br>
<br>

# Implementation

## Connection
To ensure a connection doesn't stay open after an abrupt crash from the other side, a timeout (`setSoTimeout()`) of [`Constants.READ_TIMEOUT`](ServerTelefono/src/fredver/constants/Constants.java) milliseconds is set to the reading `Socket`. To keep the connection alive, a heartbeat with an interval of [`Constants.HEATBEAT_INTERVAL`](ServerTelefono/src/fredver/constants/Constants.java) milliseconds is set
<br>
<br>
## Security
I use `Socket` to ensure a secure communication, the server using an implementation of a self-signed certificate, so you have to know the server administrator and ask him to give you the certificate verification information. This is to protect the server from eavesdropping and MITM attacks, making all connections private. No need for a `SSLSocket`, since endpoint encryption in implemented manually in the certificate itself, which is simply a public/private key pair. See the [First connection](#first-connection) section<br>
<br>
I don't even want to think about implementing a defense against DDoS attacks, and that is mainly for these reasons:
  - It requires cutting edge implementations of complex technologies, out of the bugdget of this project;
  - Data is privately transported between client and server, so no hacker can read it, and that is what matters. If this project will expand to the point that it will be used to run important services that could be the object of an attack, then the appropriate security measures will be surely implemented.
To make a server generate a new certificate, a message with header title [`NEW_CERTIFICATE`](ServerTelefono/src/fredver/ioutils/HeaderTitle.java) is sent (see the [Header titles](#header-titles) section), and an answer with the new key is sent. At restarting, the server will use the new key.

<br>
<br>

## Installation
The server is installed in the folder where the executable is located. To start up the server from another location please use a shortcut. Here it will keep information about its users, and the data.

## Custom protocol
In [fredver.ioutils](ServerTelefono/src/fredver/ioutils) package there is the implementation of the classes used for my own protocol.

### First connection
On first connection of the client with the server, a session key pair is generated by the client, and stored for use during that session.
Then:
  1. A message with header title [`PUBLIC_KEY`](ServerTelefono/src/fredver/ioutils/HeaderTitle.java) is sent using the already known server's public key for encryption, and the header body is the public key of the client (See the [Header titles](#header-titles) section) for the server to use by encrypting messages
  2. The server reads the message, takes the `PUBLIC_KEY`, and stores it in its map of public keys associated with socket connections.

Now the server and the client have established a secure bridge of connection that protects them from eavesdropping and MITM attacks.

### Structure 
To have a formal definition of what is a valid message, it has to match this regex:
```
^([a-fA-F0-9]{32});([0-9]{1,15});([^;]{1,50});([^;]{1,4096});(.+)$
```

Which represents none other than a string structured, in the order the fields appear, separated by the [`MESSAGE_HEADER_FIELDS_SEPARATOR`](ServerTelefono/src/fredver/constants/Constants.java), like this: 
|Field name|Represented information's type|Represented information's size|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|UUID|Hexadecimal string|Exactly 32 characters|An UUID of the message, for the server to respond to exact requests, by putting as the message's UUID the one of the client's request.|
|Raw data length|Number|1 to 15 digits|To indicate the size of the raw data section of the message, used to determine if there is enough storage to hold a file or folder before sending|
|Header title|String|1 to 50 characters|To indicate the nature of the message, choosing from header titles as specified in the [`HeaderTitle`](ServerTelefono/src/fredver/ioutils/HeaderTitle.java) enum|
|Header body|String|1 to 4096 characters|To specify information about what the message is about. Example: if the header title was `PATH_OPERATION`, then the header body could be [`HEADER_BODY_RMDIR`](ServerTelefono/src/fredver/ioutils/Header.java)|
|Raw data|Base85 encoded byte stream|The maximum number of bytes representable with the maximum number of digits of the field "Raw data length"|To send raw data through the connection, as all other communication, like metadata, is done in the header|

A message ends and a new one starts when [`MESSAGE_END_SEPARATOR`](ServerTelefono/src/fredver/constants/Constants.java) is reached. It is not put in the valid message's regex because the raw data can be several gigabytes of data, and it obviously won't be sent all at once, so in some cases there's no way to establish whether there is a message ending character or not.<br>
<br>
The header body is of a maximum of 4096 characters because that's the max path of linux, and the header body is used, at its max length, to represent file paths.<br>
<br>
The raw-data-length information is used to know immediately upon sending a message if the server has enough storage to save the file. It serves no other purpose.<br>

<br>
<br>

There can be only a header, and it has to have its their title match one of the titles' names specified by the [`HeaderTitle`](ServerTelefono/src/fredver/ioutils/HeaderTitle.java) enum. No field can ever not have a value, the default "non-value" is "null", as defined in [`Constants.NULL_VALUE`](ServerTelefono/src/fredver/constants/Constants.java).
Each message it is sent in mind with the fact that the user is currently in a specific directory, so, for example, if a message with [`LIST_FILES_AND_DIRECTORIES`](ServerTelefono/src/fredver/ioutils/HeaderTitle.java) header is sent, then it will list all the files and directories in that specific directory.
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

### Encoding of raw data

When the server or the client are communicating raw data, base85 encoding of the files data is used.<br>
Why? Because sending raw data does not leave free characters to use as delimiters to differentiate between the different files' data and filenames, when transmitting multiple of them with the same message.<br>
<br>
Then why not Base64?<br>
Because it adds padding (`=` characters) if encoded bytes are not a multiple of `3`, and this has the consequence that it will not be distinguishable from actual data, because it flows like a stream from one socket to the other.<br>To avoid the padding's creation, you obviously cannot load into memory the file in its whole to transmit it so that the server can load it all into memory and then revert it back to normal encoding, because that puts a memory burden that could not be supported by either the client or the server.<br>
Base85, also, reduces the space occupied by data, so that it is faster to transmit via sockets. This is the same optimization result of having a bigger buffer. <br> **
<br>
File data, or data of multiple files, is structured inside the raw data section as per the folllowing explanation:
  - The file name and data are separated by the constant [`fredver.constants.Constants.FILE_NAME_AND_FILE_DATA_SEPARATOR`](ServerTelefono/src/fredver/constants/Constants.java), which is not a value encoded by base85 encoding
  - A file's data and the next file's name are separated by the constant[`fredver.constants.FILE_DATA_AND_NEXT_FILE_NAME_SEPARATOR`](ServerTelefono/src/fredver/constants/Constants.java), which is not a value encoded by base85 encoding.

<br>

### Header titles
Here is a comprehensive table with all possible values header titles values, as defined in [`HeaderTitle`](ServerTelefono/src/fredver/ioutils/HeaderTitle.java), and how they are used based on if the server or client sends it.<br>
<br>
There can be various answers in the body, they can be those defined in [fredver.ioutils.Header](ServerTelefono/src/fredver/ioutils/Header.java), or [fredver.constants.NULL_VALUE](ServerTelefono/src/fredver/constants/Constants.java).

## Console
The server through the console can be able to:
  - Run in online or offline mode
  - Manage its online status
  - Manage its users
  - Navigate through the folders and manage them
  - Manage the active connections
  - Benchmark and get the specs of the machine the server is running on
  - Change or set up a new certificate of the server manually. 
<br>
The console can be able to be accessed remotely, you just have to be logged in as administrator.<br>
The console can run in offline mode, but has to be specified at startup. In this mode you can manage files, users, and benchmark and get the specs of the machine the server is running on.


<br>
<br>

## Client
The client is able to:
- to connect to the server specifying its ip address and port, with a functionality to save those info for later reuse, and change them to a different one.
- access the console if it is an admin, otherwise a specific menu based on its authorization level. See [`fredver.clientserver.PermissionLevel`](ServerTelefono/src/fredver/clientserver/PermissionLevel.java) enum.
- change or set up a new certificate of the server and get it.
- based on its certification level:
  - navigate through the folders 
  - get files and directories
  - upload files and directories
  - create files and directories

<br>
<br>

## Storage
Each user will have its partition, a folder with their name as name of the folder. If, for any operation, storage is not enough, it will delete the data that was writing.

<br>
<br>

## User management
**TODO**
There may be multiple users, each having their dedicated folder under the users folder. Each user has a password and username, which they have to use to connect to the server. Each user has their access level, from the defined ones in [fredver.clientserver.PermissionLevel](ServerTelefono/src/fredver/clientserver/PermissionLevel.java) enum. Each user can only interact with the contents of its user folder, unless it's the admin.<br>
The admin can set a limit, which is ***highly recommended***, of how much storage a user has allocated to himself (his folder). 

<br>
<br>


## Concurrency
>[!WARNING]
Just in case there is a bug, always keep at least two users with the maximum permissions if you plan on using the server remotely, since if one connection, for some reason, is not closed properly, at least with the other one you can restart the server and not lose access.

This is ***very*** important to keep the synchronization, the same user can only have one active connection with the server, ***not more***.
Only one client can connect to the server with a specific user, so only one instance of the same user can be connected to the server at the same time. If more try to connect the server simply refuses from the second request onward, and does not accept new logins until the active connection is terminated. 
Multiple connections to the server may be opened at same time, and the server has to process them all at the same time.
Messages can be sent at any moment from the clients and from the server, so they both have to be ready to process all messages at all times. This application implements a full duplex.

: USEFUL INFORMATION IN THIS NEXT CODE BLOCK**
```
Users with low permissions can only access their folder, so no conflict can come from them, unless an admin starts doing stuff on their folders while they are doing stuff too, like deleting and reading at the same time, for example. Read, modify, and write operations could clash. Read operations could read from a file that is being deleted, or try to read while a file is being deleted, so they might be then doing operations on a file that doesn't exist anymore. Two of the same file could be tried to be created at the same time, and this could be a problem.
In substance:
- When creating a file, you have to block read, delete, and create operations to that file specifically.
- When you read from a file, you cannot delete the file until it has finished reading. You can obviously not create it, as it already exists
- When deleting a file, you have to block reading and deleting that file. Then you have to make it so that the aforementioned operations will not give problems now that the file that is object of those operations does not exist anymore. You obviously cannot create it since it already exists.
```

The server uses a `java.util.HashSet` to keep track of all active connections, as it yields the best performances when randomly removing elements.
